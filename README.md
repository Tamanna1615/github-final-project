# Simple Interest Calculator

This project provides a simple Bash script to calculate **simple interest** based on user inputs.  
The user enters:

- Principal amount  
- Rate of interest  
- Time period  

The script then calculates the simple interest using the formula:

**Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100**
